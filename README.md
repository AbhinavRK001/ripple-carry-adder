In this repository I have created a ripple carry adder which can add upto 4bits. A ripple carry adder is used over a full adder or other adder as in a hald or full addder the ic doesnt function when the input bits are high but in case of ripple carry adder the i/p and o/p can be of any no. of bits and it will still perform the task.
The circuit of the ripple carry adder is as shown below

One of the main advantages that a ripple carry adder has is that it doesnt require the constant input of the cin. as cin of block 2 is connected to cout of block 1, the o/p is carried over, hence the name
the simulation for the adder is as shown below
